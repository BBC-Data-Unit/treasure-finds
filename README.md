In November 2017 we [contributed to a report by Laurence Cawley](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-42079561) on the number of reported annual treasure finds across England topping more than 1,000 for the first time since records began.

In addition to the data analysis, BBC News asked Ian Richardson, the treasure registrar for the Portable Antiquities Scheme, to name five recent finds that he considered significant.
